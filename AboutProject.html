            <h3>Abstract:</h3>
            <p>The project aims to predict Emotional Intelligence (EI) in individuals based on their fluid intelligence.
                Emotional
                Intelligence plays a crucial role in personal and professional success, and understanding its
                relationship with
                fluid intelligence can provide valuable insights. The project utilizes Bloom's Taxonomy for cognitive
                assessment to
                establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating both fluid intelligence and its impact on Emotional
                Intelligence.</p>

            <h3>Project Purpose:</h3>
            <p>The primary purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between fluid intelligence and
                emotional
                intelligence. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a model that can predict an
                individual's
                emotional intelligence scores based on their performance in fluid intelligence tasks.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
            <p>In a fast-paced world marked by information overload and multitasking demands, managing multiple tasks
                simultaneously
                can strain cognitive abilities, impacting performance negatively. The central objective is to create a
                system
                proficient in analyzing users' Working Load and Fluid Intelligence, correlating these with their
                Emotional
                Intelligence (EI), and providing accurate suggestions for improvement.</p>

            <h3>Solution and Expected Result:</h3>
            <p>The proposed solution involves the development of a machine learning model that analyzes data from fluid
                intelligence
                assessments to predict an individual's emotional intelligence. We expect the model to reveal patterns
                and
                relationships that contribute to a deeper understanding of the cognitive basis of emotional
                intelligence. The
                anticipated result is a reliable predictive tool that can estimate an individual's emotional
                intelligence with a
                high degree of accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Project Benefits:</h3>
            <p>Enhanced Understanding: The project aims to provide insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying
                emotional
                intelligence, contributing to a better understanding of the relationship between fluid intelligence and
                emotional
                intelligence.</p>

            <h3>Problem Domain:</h3>
            <p>The business domain for this project lies at the intersection of cognitive assessment, human resources,
                and personal
                development. Organizations across various sectors, including education, recruitment, and professional
                training, can
                benefit from a reliable tool that assesses emotional intelligence based on fluid intelligence.
                Individuals seeking
                to enhance their emotional intelligence for personal and professional growth are also part of the target
                audience.</p>

            <p>The high-level technical domain encompasses the fields of machine learning, data science, and cognitive
                psychology.
                Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the project involves the analysis of data gathered from
                fluid
                intelligence assessments. Feature engineering, model training, and validation are critical components
                within the
                technical domain. Additionally, the project may involve the integration of the developed model into
                user-friendly
                interfaces or platforms for practical applications, such as online assessments or training programs.</p>
